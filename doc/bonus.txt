* The app is crossplatform for Android and iOS. For us, it should be taken into account as a bonus because there is some difficulties we had to deal with in react-native to make this application working :
  - Camera usage is very different from Android to iOS because of the rights it needs.
  - The Application style differs too, it is not all the time possible to use an unique style between these OS because of the phone notch and the status bar.
  - The non-possibility to test the application on a real device for iOS.
  - Dependencies installation requires sometimes hard work to be stable, especially on iOS.
